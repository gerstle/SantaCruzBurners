When the files on your difficult drive turn into fragmented, your laptop or computer has to work additional hard when you are opening up particular files and programs, which can lead to a slow PC.  By defragmenting your tough drive, you're basically “cleaning house” and allowing your personal computer to operate far more effectively, therefore speeding up your computer system by putting points back into order.
