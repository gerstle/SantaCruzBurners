Santa Cruz Burners, South Bay Burners, Silicon Valley Burners, EBB, SFB, Sac, et al, we do events at LUPIN NATURIST LODGE, 20600 Aldercroft Heights Road, including SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2010, contact RealGirl at SBB.

If we can get to Winchester Station with the bike, ride West, until it changes name to SANTA CRUZ Avenue, go left at MAIN Street, under Highway 17, and pick up the trail, along 17, toward Lexington Reservoir.

Bikers need to ride around on ALMA BRIDGE ROAD, all the way to the end of Lexington, and watch for the road to swing up to the left, toward Lupin:
