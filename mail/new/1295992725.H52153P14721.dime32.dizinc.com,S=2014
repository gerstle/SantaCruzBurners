Comment: 
When next I read a blog,  I pray that it doesnt  let me down as much as this one did. I mean, I know it was my decision to read it, but somehow I actually  thought  that you'd have something  well considered to say. All I hear  is a bunch of  moaning about  a challenge that you could solve if you werent too  preoccupiedlooking for  attention.
