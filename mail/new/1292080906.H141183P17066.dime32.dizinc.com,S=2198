Comment: 
The city is a vibrant collage of cultures and people. There is a firm belief that ‘once a Cape Townian always a Cape Townian’. There’s something special about the blend of diversity that is local Cape Town culture. Even though the demand for Cape Town properties is high, the city has remained small. The flat-topped Table Mountain is the heart of the city. It is to the mountain that local inhabitants glance to get their bearings. Table Mountain is surrounded by the city and is within the view of many Cape Town properties.
