Comment: 
I enjoyed reading the blog post, thanks for sharing the info. Itâ€™s not too often that you find a post where the poster knows what they are talking about. Spelling and Grammar are right on as well, only problem I seemed to have was viewing the website, seemed kinda slow. Any other visitors have the same issue?
