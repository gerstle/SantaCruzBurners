Comment: 
The all-new Ford Focus made a pretty big splash when it debuted at the Detroit Auto Show this past January. The new car, which will be offered in both sedan and hatchback flavors, rides on the automaker’s new global C-car platform, and the version that America gets won’t be noticeably different from the European model. A good thing, as we’ve been crying for Euro-tuned Foci for years, though it’s safe to assume that the hot new Focus wagon won’t be headed to our shores.
