Comment: 
I agree with you when you said one of the skills you have gained is networking. After attending some of the Exchange Club of Mobile meetings and other civic meetings around town with our director, I have realized that networking is extremely important. I have never been one who wants to sit around and listen to who is more successful or whose company has the most investments. However, when working for a non-profit, it is more than just that. You have to have support from businesses and sometimes people who like to sit around and talk about how successful they are. If that means your group, who ultimately is there to help the community in some way, is funded by those people, you have to take care of business, and listen as long as they want to talk. Networking in our society has become a major factor in whether individuals and companies/agenices make it, and it has to be done.
