Comment: 
It appears like a fake to relaunch an out-of-business dating platform like Meezoog. Absolutely nothing mentions TPB on that website, neither within the Meezoog's blog: on its approximate Facebook Connect software, Pirate Date (counting just 2 fans, right now) cites TPB for its "concept", but I wasn't capable of find any announcement about an official partnership with TPB or considered one of its founders. In case you notice, Pirate Date doesn't show the actual TPB logo: the ship was a tiny transformed including an hearth within the sails and that font family in the header could quickly be employed by anybody.
