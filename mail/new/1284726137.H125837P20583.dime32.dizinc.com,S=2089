Comment: 
I love this blog. For a while, I told myself I should be trying to create one just like this as well, though I am not savvy enough on how to do it. Tell me about this so-called web2.0 platform? Is it hard? Is it required to be an expert in computers to create a blog? I would like to hammer together a similar blog for my <a href="http://www.my-english-writing.com" rel="nofollow">ESL</A> esl website. Can Wordpress be combined into a present website?
