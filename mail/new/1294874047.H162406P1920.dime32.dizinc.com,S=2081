Hi, Just returned here to remind you about Mobile Monopoly. It is a great technique and WILL make you money, especially seeing as you own a website. Take a quick look at the video, the strategy is about using Mobile Advertising which is completely new and an unexposed market where you can make thousands by doing hardly any work. I promise you that after you watch their short video it will change you and it will start making you think. http://mobile-mastermind.com
