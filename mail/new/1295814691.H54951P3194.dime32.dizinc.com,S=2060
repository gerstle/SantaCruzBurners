Comment: 
Thanks for taking the time to talk about this, I feel strongly about it and I benefit from learning about this topic. Please, as you gain facts, please add to this blog with new information. I have found it extremely useful. All of this could be an incidental effect of how the insurance companies lost thousands of customers over the past year – customers who could no longer afford cover, now that they don’t have jobs.
