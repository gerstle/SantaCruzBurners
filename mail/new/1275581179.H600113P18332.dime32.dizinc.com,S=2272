Comment: 
Tonight is Dust &amp; Illusions, 30 years of Burning Man. DUST &amp; ILLUSIONS is a fresh look at Burning Man. I didn't make the film to convince people to go there, NOR did I make the film to "re-create" the Burning Man experience. I made the film to present a perspective on 30 years of evolution. I have unearthed passage of history that even most participants of the early burns have never heard about. I did it to bring all of you one night in a theater so we can reflect together on how relevant what we're doing in the desert is, and what we can do to make it even more relevant.
