Comment: 
I actually love this idea, and also have been considering about this sort of matter for a while now (the way to far better leverage personal connections for online dating). The on the web relationship area is damaged. It's like impersonal shopping, and it is a house that may be grossly overdue for a tune up that integrates social connections in a very neat and useful way. Leveraging Facebook to allow men and women to play matchmaker, makes a ton of sense.
