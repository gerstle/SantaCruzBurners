Hello, i learn your weblog often and that i own the same one and i used to be just questioning in the event you get loads of spam feedback? If so how do you stop it, any plugin or something you may advocate? I am getting a lot these days it's driving me mad so any help may be very much appreciated.  Anyway, in my language, there aren't much good supply like this.
