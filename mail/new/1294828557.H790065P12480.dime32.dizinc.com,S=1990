good point. I just came across a report about ecigs reducing the risk of cancer. Makes me really think about transitioning to ecigs after researching this information. If everyone switched to electronic cigarettes the yearly death rate would decrease from 400,000 to 4,000 deaths per year! Unbelievable! <a href="http://www.ecigforums.info" rel="nofollow">ecig forum.com</a>
