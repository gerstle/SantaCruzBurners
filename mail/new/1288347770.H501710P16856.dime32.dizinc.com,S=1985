Comment: 
I’ve been experiencing this kind of sneaky spam since last year. And it has only gotten worse this time around. It’s a good thing I’ve developed a quick eye for such spam comments that look legitimate. What’s kind of annoying though is it seems that Akismet is slow in learning about this, a few comments still manage to get through.
