Hi, maybe i'm being a slightly off topic here, but I was browsing your site and it looks fine.  I'm writing a blog and trying to make it look neat, but everytime I touch it I mess something up.  Did you design the blog yourself? Could someone with little experience do it, and add updates without messing it up? Anyways, good information on here, very useful.
