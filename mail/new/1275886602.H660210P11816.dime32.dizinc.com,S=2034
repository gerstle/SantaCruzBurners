Comment: 
hello i posted a comment a little while back on the subject of exactly how to speed up my twilight eclipse website's load time considering we used the same theme at that time and somebody left a comment responding to it on my web site a couple of days ago - if that was you I simply wanted to say many thanks, and if it wasn't you then sorry to bother you, but thanks anyway!  :)
