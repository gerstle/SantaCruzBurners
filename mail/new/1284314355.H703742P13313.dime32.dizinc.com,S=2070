Comment: 
I love this blog. For a while, I have toyed with the idea of trying to make one just like this as well, but not computer gifted on how to do it. Tell me about this "Wordpress" software? Is it easy to learn? Is it required to be savvy in computers to put together a blog? I want to design a simple blog for my <a href="http://www.my-english-writing.com" rel="nofollow">sample essay</A> esl website. Can the functions be integrated into a present website?
