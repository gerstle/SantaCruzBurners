Comment: 
I in fact enjoy this concept, and also have been pondering about this sort of issue for some time now (the way to greater leverage personalized connections for on the net dating). The on the web courting room is damaged. It can be like impersonal purchasing, and it can be a space that is grossly overdue for a tune up that integrates social connections in a very neat and successful way. Leveraging Facebook to allow men and women to play matchmaker, helps make a ton of sense.
